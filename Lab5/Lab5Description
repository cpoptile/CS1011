	This program estimates the value of pi when the user inputs an integer value of points to be
plotted. Pi is estimated by randomly plotting the number of points “inside a 1x1 square.” The 
estimate of pi is calculated using the ratio of dots that would fall under the curve of a quarter 
circle with a radius of 1 and the total number of points. The best estimate of pi is kept and 
recorded as the program offers to continually generate a new estimate until the user decides to stop.
