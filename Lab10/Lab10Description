The objective of this lab is essentially the same as lab 9, which was to implement an API for 
parking lots in a district. Going off UML diagrams that were given, the ParkingLot and District 
classes needed to be created, working, and compatible with the ParkingDriver class. This District 
class, however, supports an arbitrary number of lots instead of the previous 3 that were hardcoded 
or 20 with an array in lab 9.
