ïƒ˜	The objective of this lab is essentially the same as lab 8, which was to implement an 
API for parking lots in a district. Going off UML diagrams that were given, the ParkingLot and 
District classes needed to be created, working, and compatible with the ParkingDriver class. This 
District class, however, supports up to twenty parking lots with an array instead of the 
previous 3 that were hardcoded.
